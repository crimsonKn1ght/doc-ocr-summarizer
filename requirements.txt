Excellent! To get your application on the web, we'll switch from the local LLaMA 3.1 model to a hosted one. This makes your app lightweight and easy to deploy on free platforms.

We'll use Groq to run the Llama 3.1 model, as it's incredibly fast and has a generous free tier. For the embeddings, we'll use a free model from Hugging Face.

Here's your step-by-step guide to making your PDF Q&A app web-hosted.

Step 1: Get Your Free Groq API Key
First, you'll need an API key from Groq to use their service.

Create an account: Go to the Groq website and sign up for a free account.

Get your API key: Once you're logged in, navigate to the "API Keys" section and create a new key. Copy it and keep it safeâ€”you'll need it in a moment.

Step 2: Update Your Project Files
Now, let's modify the code to use Groq and prepare it for deployment.

A. Updated requirements.txt
Your new requirements.txt will need a few changes. We're adding libraries for Streamlit, Groq, and Hugging Face embeddings, and removing langchain-ollama.
